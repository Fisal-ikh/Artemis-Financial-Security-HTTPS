# Project: Secure Software Development for Artemis Financial

## Competencies

In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competencies:

1. Write secure communications through the application of current encryption technologies and techniques.
2. Design and implement code that complies with software security testing protocols.

## Scenario

You work as a developer for a software engineering company, Global Rain, that specializes in custom software design and development. The software is for entrepreneurs, businesses, and government agencies around the world. Part of the company’s mission is that "Security is everyone’s responsibility." Global Rain has promoted you to their new agile scrum team.

At Global Rain, you work with a client, Artemis Financial, a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance.

Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations. As a crucial part of the success of their custom software, they also want to use the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a public web interface. They are seeking Global Rain’s expertise about how to protect their client data and financial information.

Specifically, Artemis Financial wants to add a file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communications. When the web application is used to transfer data, they will need a data verification step in the form of a checksum. You must take their current software application and add secure communication mechanisms to meet their software security requirements. You’ll deliver a production quality integrated application that includes secure coding protocols.

## Project Details

### Directions

You must examine Artemis Financial’s software to address any security vulnerabilities. This will require you to refactor the Project Two Code Base, linked in the Supporting Materials section, to add functionality to meet software security requirements for Artemis Financial’s application. Specifically, you’ll need to follow the steps outlined below to facilitate your findings, address and remedy all areas, and use the Project Two Template, linked in What to Submit, to document your work for your practices for secure software report. You will also submit zipped files that contain the refactored code.

## Getting Started

Please follow the instructions in the Project Two Template and the Project Two Code Base to begin working on this project. Ensure that you address and document all security requirements and code changes as described.

## What to Submit

1. Zipped files containing the refactored code.
2. The completed Project Two Template documenting your work.
